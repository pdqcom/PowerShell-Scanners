<#
Due to a bug in Inventory, we want this script to always emit an object, even if no updates were found.

When you set a variable equal to the output of a cmdlet and that cmdlet returns nothing, your variable
will contain an empty PSCustomObject.
ForEach-Object skips empty PSCustomObjects, but not objects that are truly empty (such as $null).
Clear-Variable sets a variable back to a truly empty object, which causes this script to emit the
PSCustomObject we build below with all of the values of its properties set to $null instead of skipping it.

Here's some code you can use to test this yourself:
$GWU = foreach ( $Thing in $null ) {}
$GWU.PSObject
$GWU | ForEach-Object { [PSCustomObject]@{ 'KB' = $_.KB } }

Clear-Variable 'GWU'
$GWU.PSObject
$GWU | ForEach-Object { [PSCustomObject]@{ 'KB' = $_.KB } }
#>
If ( $null -eq $GWU ) {

    Clear-Variable 'GWU'

}

$GWU | ForEach-Object {
    # This accounts for Updates that don't return a size
    if ($_.Size) {
        # Convert to bytes so it will display properly in Inventory
        $Size = [UInt64](Invoke-Expression $_.Size)
